# Bird-Strike-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
Bird strikes pose a major aviation safety risk, often causing damage during takeoff or landing. Increasing incidents highlight the need to understand risk factors. Using large datasets, our project applies machine learning to predict strike damage, combining impact mechanics, data analysis, and predictive modeling to enhance aviation safety.
